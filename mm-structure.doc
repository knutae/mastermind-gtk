This is a GTK+-version of mastermind.  This file is my attempt to get some
thoughts down on "paper" before I start coding...

Classes/structs:

Mastermind:  contains all graphical and logical info about the game.
1 object only, so I won't actually make it a struct.  (in c++, I probaly
would make it a class, but I'll just skip it)

MmField:  The places where you put the colors.  Can be empty or contain a
color.  Two states; active and inactive -- active ones can be changed by the
user.
Contains:  color (0..8), GtkWidget
Functions: mmFieldSetColor(field, 0..8)

MmSolutionSeq:  The secret color sequence.  Contains four fields.  Are revealed
after the game.
Contains:  MmField[4], GtkBox (hbox)
Functions: mmSolutionSeqInit(solseq), mmSolutionSeqShow(solseq),
	   mmSolutionSeqNew(solseq)

MmTrySeq:  One user attempt, four fields.  Mastermind contains ten of these.
Contains:  MmField[4], handler[4], MmFeedback, GtkBox (hbox)
Functions: mmTrySeqEval(seq, solseq), mmTrySeqSetActive|Inactive(solseq),
	   mmTrySeqInit(seq), mmTrySeqNew(seq)

MmBW:  Black/White "feedback element".  Empty, black or white.
Contains:  color (0..2), GtkWidget
Functions: mmBWSetColor(bw, 0..2)

Feedback:  Four BWs, giving feedback to the user.
Contains:  MmBW[4], GtkTable
Functions: mmFeedbackSetColors(feedback, blacks, whites),
	   mmFeedbackInit(feedback), mmFeedBackNew(feedback)

Global stuff (these would be in MmMastermind if I made it):
1 MmSolutionSeq, 10 MmTrySeq
GtkBox (vbox containing MmSolutionSeq and 10 MmTrySeq)
3 Buttons (try, give up, quit)

Global functions:  newTry(), newGame(), main()

Note:  this file is not fully up to date, but can probably still be of use
if you want to understand the source.  Good luck... :-)
